# 🔧 Render Start Script Fix

## Issue Identified
Render is trying to run `yarn start` but there's no `start` script in package.json. The build succeeds but deployment fails.

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. Added Start Script
Updated `package.json` to include:
```json
"start": "vite preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000"
```

### 2. Updated Render Configuration
Changed `render.yaml` from `type: web` to `type: static` for the frontend service.

## 🚀 Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Push the Fix
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Render start script issue"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Redeploy on Render
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your frontend service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait for deployment to complete

### Step 3: Alternative - Recreate Service
If the above doesn't work, recreate the frontend service:

1. **Delete the current frontend service** in Render dashboard
2. **Create a new Static Site:**
   - Click "New +" → "Static Site"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - **Name**: `skillforge-frontend`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build:render`
   - **Publish Directory**: `dist`
   - **Environment Variables**:
     - `VITE_API_URL=https://skillforge-backend.onrender.com/api`
     - `VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://skillforge-backend.onrender.com`

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

1. **Missing Start Script**: Render was looking for a `start` command that didn't exist
2. **Wrong Service Type**: Frontend should be `static` not `web` service
3. **Package Manager Mismatch**: Render was using `yarn` but we configured for `npm`

## ✅ Expected Result

After the fix:
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ Static site deploys correctly
- ✅ Frontend loads on Render URL
- ✅ SPA routing works properly

## 🚨 If Still Failing

### Check Render Logs
1. Go to your service → "Logs" tab
2. Look for the specific error message
3. Check if it's still trying to run `yarn start`

### Alternative Configuration
If you prefer to use `yarn`, update the build command in Render:
```
yarn install && yarn build:render
```

### Manual Deploy
You can also manually deploy by:
1. Running `npm run build:render` locally
2. Uploading the `dist` folder to Render

## 📋 Summary

The issue was that Render expected a `start` script for web services, but static sites don't need one. By changing to `type: static` and adding the start script as a fallback, the deployment should work correctly.

Your frontend should now deploy successfully on Render! 🎉
